# HTML-Creator
Just a simple script in python that generates code in HTML. (WIP)

Please credit and link back to this repository if you use this in one of your projects or if you modify the code.  Thanks :)


ðŸ‘¾FeaturesðŸ‘¾
- Creates HTML code with one main heading, and unlimited amount of subheadings & paragraphs.
- Bullets and lists added!
- User can change the last piece of text they put in if they're unnhappy with it.
- Write the code to a new HTML file (WIP)
- ... ***crickets***


âœ¨Bugsâœ¨
- Program copies a blank message to clipboard, user needs to copy/paste manually (can be solved by implementing writing to file)

ðŸ’«GoalsðŸ’«
- Going back to previous lines to edit after confirming them
- Covert .py to .exe to you shouldn't have to have python installed for this to work. (Still trying to figure this part out ðŸ¥´)
