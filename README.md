👾Features👾
- Creates HTML code with one main heading, and unlimited amount of subheadings & paragraphs.
- User can change the last piece of text they put in if they're unnhappy with it.
- ... ***crickets***


✨Bugs✨
- ~~Program repeats itself after first creation, second time it works as normal.~~ I'm a clown and I didn't realize the code is literally pasted there twice 🤦🏾‍♂️
- Program copies a blank message to clipboard, user needs to copy/paste manually

💫Goals💫
- Introduce numbered and bulleted lists
- Heading & body
- Going back to previous lines to edit after confirming them
- .exe
